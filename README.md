## Available commands

### `develop` (or `dev`)

Start your Strapi application with autoReload enabled. [Learn more](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/cli#strapi-develop)

```
yarn develop
```

### `test`

Launch your tests. Setup based on [this](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/testing) + improved in this repo to allow running tests individually.

```console
yarn test
```

> [!NOTE]
> Because of the way the `strapi` constant is initialised and made available to the tests, the tests must run in band (already specified when running `yarn test`), and `--watch` is not available.

The tests use a test PostgreSQL database that is installed when you run `yarn docker:dev`. This database schema is setup and cleared every time you run the tests, check `tests/setup/strapi.ts` for more details.

If you get duplicate key errors while running tests, it might mean that the database was not cleared properly. To clear it manually, run:

```console
yarn test:reset-database
```

Which will drop the Docker test database container and volume and recreate it.

### `start`

Start your Strapi application with autoReload disabled. [Learn more](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/cli#strapi-start)

```
yarn start
```

### `build`

Build your admin panel. [Learn more](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/cli#strapi-build)

```
yarn build
```
